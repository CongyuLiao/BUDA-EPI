The data size is ~ 20 GB, and the scan protocol is similar to the protocol of human connectom project (HCP):
•	FOV: 220 mm *220mm, matrix size: 176*176
•	In-plane resolution: 1.25 mm *1.25mm
•	Slice thickness: 2mm
•	Number of slices: 57
•	Number of coils: 32
•	TR/TE = 2800/77 ms
•	Effective echo-spacing = 0.37 ms
•	Multi-band factor: 3 with CAPI-shift FOV/2 per shot
•	In-plane acceleration factor :2 per shot
•	partial Fourier factor: 0.75
•	BUDA acquisition with AP shot kyshift 1 and PA shot kyshift 0
•	Two shells: b= 1000 with 32 diffusion directions and b=2500 with 64 diffusion directions
